# Simple Calculator using Tkinter

This is a simple calculator application built using Python and Tkinter. The calculator provides a user-friendly graphical interface for performing basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Add, subtract, multiply, divide, and calculate percentages.
- **Clear Functionality**: Reset the calculator screen using the "C" button.
- **Error Handling**: Displays "Error" for invalid inputs.
- **Responsive UI**:
  - Buttons change color on hover for better user experience.
  - Dynamically created buttons for an organized and scalable layout.
- **Intuitive Design**: The calculator UI is clean and easy to use.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
3. Run the `calculator.py` file in your Python environment:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```
4. Use the buttons in the UI to perform calculations.

## Code Highlights

- **Dynamic Button Creation**: Buttons are generated programmatically based on their labels, ensuring scalability and minimal code repetition.
- **Error Handling**: The program gracefully handles invalid inputs using the `try-except` block in the `click` function.
- **Interactive UI**: Button hover effects and responsive design enhance user experience.

### Main Components

- **Screen Display**: An entry widget (`Entry`) shows the current input and results.
- **Buttons**: 
  - Number buttons (0â€“9) for digit inputs.
  - Operator buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) for calculations.
  - `C` button to clear the input.
  - `=` button to evaluate the expression.

### Core Functionality (`click` Function)
The `click` function handles button clicks:
- Appends text to the input screen for number and operator buttons.
- Clears the input when "C" is pressed.
- Evaluates the mathematical expression when "=" is pressed, handling errors appropriately.
