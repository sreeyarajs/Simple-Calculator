# Simple Calculator

## Description

This is a **Simple calculator** built using Python and Tkinter. It provides a user-friendly interface to perform a variety of mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and more. The application supports custom operators like `π` and `e`, along with advanced scientific operations such as square roots, sine, cosine, tangent, and logarithms.

The app dynamically updates the screen with results, and handles errors such as invalid inputs gracefully by displaying "Error" on the screen.

### Features:
- **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Functions**: Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic functions (log, ln), and others like square root, floor, ceil, etc.
- **Custom Operators**: Supports the use of `π` (pi) and `e` (Euler's number) in calculations.
- **Dynamic Error Handling**: The calculator handles invalid inputs and errors, displaying an "Error" message when needed.
- **Hover Effects**: Buttons have a hover effect with color changes when the mouse is over them, enhancing the user experience.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- **Tkinter**: This GUI application uses the Tkinter library, which is included with Python by default. If it's not installed, you can install it via your package manager.

## Usage

- **Basic Calculations**: Enter numbers and operators on the screen. Press the `=` button to calculate the result.
- **Scientific Operations**: Press buttons like `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `sqrt`, `log`, `ln`, etc., to perform scientific operations on the displayed number.
- **Error Handling**: If an invalid operation is entered (e.g., division by zero), "Error" will be displayed on the screen.
- **Clear**: Press the `C` button to clear the screen.
- **Power Operations**: Use `x²` for squaring a number, `x³` for cubing, and `1/x` for computing the reciprocal.
